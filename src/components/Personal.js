            <p>I am a young React Developer who has decided to take a dive in the deep end by changing his current language industry.</p>
                <p>I have been passionate about foreign languages for years and have consistently developed my passions during my education - to the extent that I can now feel confident in six foreign languages - English, French, Norwegian, Polish, Swedish and Danish. 
                Searching for new experiences, I thought that since my path with foreign languages is coming to an end, I decided that it’s time for something completely new - programming languages! </p>
                I know, I know, I wasn’t looking too far, but well, I certainly count it as something new - an adventure, which, despite my short experience in this new industry, showed me a new style of thinking and completely new challenges that stand in my way. My IT journey started with Python and still it’s the language that has a special place in my heart. 
                When I was studying online under MIT, I created a strong foundation of the basics of Computer Science, and in turn, I learnt how to think as a Programmer, by using various frameworks such as Django for Python or React for Javascript.
