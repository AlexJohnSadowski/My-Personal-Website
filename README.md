# My Personal website!

## www.alexsadowski.pl

### My personal website was written using Gatsby and SCSS. The old version (that included only HTML, CSS and vanilla JS) I wrote long time ago, so I decided that it's time to tweak it a little bit.

PS yeah, I know the viewports are not ideal and I need to fix them in future projects, but at least you can find all responsive models tailored perfectly for you ;)
